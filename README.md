# Aspicio
2017 Mountain View Hacks submission

## What it does
Instead of walking with a cane or some other aid, visually impaired people walk around with their phone with Aspicio running. The lightweight app built with angular takes constant pictures and connects to a python based server to analyze the photos. With the use of powerful GPU's in the cloud, the image is processed almost instantly and sent back to the phone which gives vibration and sound feedback if an obstacle is there.
